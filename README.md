# The-Quantum-Teleportation-Algorithm
In this repository, I have programmed The Quantum Teleportation Algorithm with the help of Qiskit.


Quantum Teleportation Algorithm
It is an algorithm used to transfer quantum states from one qubit to another. This means that we are transferring information from one qubit to another and not the qubit itself.

Why do we use this algorithm ?
In quantum computers, when we try to copy information the quantum state gets collapsed to a single state as we are indirectly applying a measurement. So, to tackle the coplying issue. We use quantum teleportation.

How will I use it ?
In order to implement this algorithm, we will be using Quantum Entanglement as a resource and build a circuit. There are many ways to run the algorithm but in this particular case I have used the QASM Simulator to run my circuit.
